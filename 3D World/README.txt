could make a new scene and copy MainPlayer into it.

All the materials are in the Urban folder - /Urban/Prefab/.  Drag whatever object you want into the scene window.  
MAKE SURE that the mesh collider is active.  
You can do this if you go into /Scripts/ and drag the AddMeshCollider script to the object in the 
Hierarchy tab (it should add a meshcollider when you run the scene).

To change the color of an object, go to /Urban/Models/Materials/ and drag whatever color you want onto the object
in the Hierarchy tab.

Have fun Designing!
